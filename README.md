## What is  the bot meant for?

I used to manage MPS teams back then, and god know how inactive they become after a few month because theyfind theirselves at the bottom of the serverlist, so no1 never see any pings etc.. Also the things were too manual, not enough automatisation for me, if you want a quick, dynamic & active team you need to automate things instead of writing everything down manually.
### What are the features available (Admin+)
 `/feedback` to send a DM thru bot to every ADMINISTRATOR & give them a message, this message could be opinion about a plr, the stat eof the team or wtv

`/setateam` to assign a role to the  A TEAM

`/setBteam` to assign a role to the  B TEAM

`/setffrole`to assign a role to the position of Friendly finder

### What are the features available (Coach+) ?
 `/Poll` which is meant to create a message followed by a ✔️reaction & a DMALL with the poll's message link

 `/promote` & `/demote` which is self-explanatory

 `/schedule` to schedule match & let players view the planning thru `/listmatches`

`/dmall` allow you to DM to every1 in a server any message you want.
